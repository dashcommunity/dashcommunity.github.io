# Welcome to Dash Commmunity

Dash Community is an open platform that incentivizes collaborative content and projects.  

Specifically, it is a [github organization](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations) separate from, and complementary to, the main [`dashpay` organization](https://github.com/dashpay).  The [`dashcommunity` organization](https://github.com/dashcommunity) hosts repositories for various purposes - something for everyone.  

This platform aims to increase community contribution and continue the general decentralization of Dash.  It achieves this by lowering the barrier to entry and raising the [financial incentive](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-dash-community/blob/master/proposal.md#table-4---compensation-for-community-participation) for software developers, writers, marketers, and anyone else to use and contribute to Dash.
