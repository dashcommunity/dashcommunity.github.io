The [`dashcommunity` organization](https://github.com/dashcommunity) hosts repositories for various purposes - something for everyone.  \r\n\r\nThis platform aims to increase community contribution and continue the general decentralization of Dash.  It achieves this by lowering the barrier to entry and raising the [financial incentive](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-dash-community/blob/master/proposal.md#table-4---compensation-for-community-participation) for software developers, writers, marketers, and anyone else to use and contribute to Dash.\r\n\r\nThis landing page provides useful links to navigate around the project content\r\n\r\n### [Guides](https://github.com/dashcommunity/guides)\r\n  * [Create a proposal from a Template](https://github.com/dashcommunity/guides/blob/master/create_proposal_from_template.md)\r\n  * [Create a proposal template](https://github.com/dashcommunity/guides/blob/master/create_proposal_template.md)\r\n  * [Set up a masternode](https://github.com/dashcommunity/guides/blob/master/set_up_masternode.md)\r\n  * [Set up a virtual private server](https://github.com/dashcommunity/guides/blob/master/set_up_virtual_private_server.md)\r\n  * [Submit a proposal to the dash network](https://github.com/dashcommunity/guides/blob/master/submit_proposal_to_network.md)\r\n\r\n### [Proposal Templates](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-templates)\r\n  * [Simple](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-templates/blob/master/simple.md)\r\n  * [Detailed](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-templates/blob/master/detailed.md) \r\n\r\n### Proposals\r\n  * [Re-created core proposal](https://dashcommunity.github.io/proposal-core-team-remake/)\r\n  * [Dash Community](https://dashcommunity.github.io/proposal-dash-community/)\r\n\r\n### [Blog](https://github.com/dashcommunity/blog)\r\n* [Dash Decentralization](https://github.com/dashcommunity/blog/blob/master/shift_to_decentralization.md)\r\n* [Write Your Own Post](https://github.com/dashcommunity/guides/blob/master/create_blog_post.md)\r\n\r\n##### [Project Management Board](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-dash-community/projects/1?fullscreen=true)",
